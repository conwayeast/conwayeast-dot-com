    <p>For the past decade I've been crafting user-centered design experiences for the web. I specialize in responsive front-end design, HTML/CSS and web typography. Some other areas of expertise are creative direction/art direction, interface design, prototyping, concepting, mobile/app design and more. Most days I work with pixels, grids, typography, colors and lines of code. Currently I work at ebay as a UX Designer. Previously at GM and Dell.</p>

    <p>I'm always interested in freelance opportunities, so don't hesitate to contact me if you are looking to fill a spot or need help with a project.</p>

    <p>Known by friends as A.J., you can find me elsewhere on the web: view my Dribbble shots, follow me on Twitter, I post internet findings on Gimmebar, I take photos on Instagram and listens to music on Rdio.</p>

    <p>Hi I'm Tony Headrick, a Midwest based branding, graphic and web designer located in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I enjoy partnering with local small-to-medium size businesses to help take their business in a new and bright direction. Whether it be a new logo, a fresh web design, or a complete website overhaul; I have the proven experience to deliver the results local businesses need to grow.</p>

    <p>Since 2006, I have partnered with such local companies as The Ginger Kitchen, Gravity Music, The League for The Blind and Disabled, Aging and In-Home Services and The Fort Wayne Derby Girls. I strive to keep the process accurate and simple by putting the client and their target market first. I am committed to staying on top of trends, best practices, and regional needs. I strive to come up with unique solutions that work for my clients.</p>

    <p>My focus is simple: to partner with individuals and companies that are ready for a positive and measurable change.</p>

    <p>If you or your company have questions, or have a project in mind that I can lend my skills to, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

    <p>I look forward to working with you to help your business grow and leave a lasting impression on your targeted market.</p>

    <p>simplicity and typography with a gimmick free focus on content and concise communication.</p>
